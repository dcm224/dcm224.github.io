Hey! My name is David Mann, I'm a freshman at Lehigh University and this is my web page. I will be posting data and articles I write on this page throughout the semester. I'm from Westchester, New York and I love basketball, football and writing about current events such as politics, COVID-19, and Artificial Intelligence. I think Data Journalism will be one of the largest growing industries along with Artificial Intelligence in the near future and I find both fields to be fascinating with a surprising amount of links between the two.

This chart above compares the two head candidates for Most Valuable Player in the NBA in 2020. Giannis Antetokumpo was the winner of the award, however there was a lot of resistance from media and the public as to whether or not he deserved it. In my opinion, Lebron James is the most valuable player in the League, and these statistics show you why. While the two players have staggeringly similar numbers when it comes to most of the stats, weighing in at 10 vs 10 for red and green, one particular statistic is what catches my eye and makes me believe that Lebron James deserved the award. It is the +/- statistic. This is one of the most useful statistics when it comes to figuring out how much a player does for his team. The stat measures the player's positive or negative effect on the team when they are on the floor playing. + a certain number means the amount of points this player on average creates for his team when playing on the court. The name of the award is Most VALUABLE Player, therefore it makes sense that the player with a higher +/- for their team would be more valuable to their organization. Lebron James has a significantly higher +/- statistic while matching Giannis Antetokumpo in nearly every other statistic, making him MY MVP.
