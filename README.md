My name is David Mann and this is my final project for my English class at Lehigh University. For this project I have decided to focus on systemic oppression and the modern Hip Hop industry in relation to black Americans.

## Poem
##                      The New York Times
I read the paper the other day, it told me a secret

It said people are being kicked from their homes for convenience

But it’s not a secret

The dollar sign defines the struggle

Being white is like being born inside a bubble

Because the world was built for you by the people it oppresses

The color of people’s skin still defines their addresses


Visit the south side and you realize there's still segregation

Gentrification pushing people away from their home

Next stop on the subway– Harlem in Vogue

And that's all she wrote

The people living there have no say,

If you don’t have the money then you cannot stay,

On the block that you and your parents have lived on for years

Wipe away your tears

That’s nothing but music to their ears

## Playlist
This playlist is a collection of rap songs that I enjoy and believe to be exemplary of rap music as an expression of the oppressed. It highlights the beauty of this art within the ugly realities of racism in America.
