My name is David Mann and this is my final project for my English 2 class at Lehigh University. For this project I have decided to focus on systemic oppression and the modern Hip Hop industry in relation to black Americans.

## The New York Times
I read the paper the other day, it told me a secret
It said people are being kicked from their homes for convenience
But it’s not a secret
The dollar sign defines the struggle
Being white is like being born inside a bubble
Because the world was built for you by the people it oppresses
The color of people’s skin still defines their addresses

Visit the south side and you realize there's still segregation
Gentrification pushing people away from their home
Next stop on the subway– Harlem in Vogue
And that's all she wrote
The people living there have no say,
If you don’t have the money then you cannot stay,
On the block that you and your parents have lived on for years
Wipe away your tears
That’s nothing but music to their ears
